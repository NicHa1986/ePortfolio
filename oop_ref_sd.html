												<p>Aside from differences between inheritance and association, I was also thinking about aggregation (in UML) the last few days of the module and what the main properties of this relationship are. I read in (Ambler, 2003) that it is similar to composition where one part is the "whole" and the other part is the "part" but in composition there is a strong dependency of the part to the whole (the strong dependency is the essential difference to aggregation) (see also (Connolly & Beg, 2015)). However, I also had always the expression of "aggregation" in mind that is also repeatedly used in Computer Science when accumulated data are requested and I didn't see a direct relation to the definition of aggregation in UML. So the question is, is aggregation in UML connected to aggregation in terms of aggregated values? Thinking about a car class helps you to answer the question. Beside a car class there can be a car brand class whereas every car brand itself has its own attributes (engine, engine power, overall weight, etc.). The interesting thing is, when one goes for an aggregation relationship (the class is outside of the car class), that this structure of a car brand class would then allow to aggregate values (the "SUM" for example) by engine (or by overall weight) in using and iterative data structure (a list or a dictionary) within the car brand class and collects into this iterable all the car brand instances that will be instantiated. However, the same is true in using a composition relationship but the iterable would then have been used outside of the car brand class. Hence, the only difference in this respect is that in using composition one always has to call the car class first (because the car brand class is living into it). To answer the question, there is no crucial difference in using aggregation or composition when a user wants to map values to aggregates. The two relationships only differ in their way to get there.</p>
