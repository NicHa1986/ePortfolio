										<p>Starting with the basics of the architecture of a generic computer (CPU, RAM, Hard Disc, I/O devices, etc.), this module really helps to get all the main vocabulary and main understanding that you need to have as a Computer Scientist. Differences between interpreter, compiler and assembly language will be explained as well as simple question such as what are digits? The answers to all this basic questions depend all on the same golden rule: "A computer only understands 0s and 1s.". Getting this main idea into mind, one will understand why efficient memory management is important, especially when your CPU on a local machine canÂ´t really handle a lot of binaries (0s and 1s) at the same time. After one has a first picture of a computer system in his mind, the module continues with the understanding of the internet and of the basic main data structures that every file management system consists of. After that, a short session about project management system will be given before it goes into algorithm design. After doing some exercises, your knowledge will be tested in terms of designing and developing your first application. The module ends with an assignment where you can look deeper into current trends in Computer Science (Cloud Management Systems, Cybersecurity, Digital Trasnformation, etc.). </p>
